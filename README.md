# my_heroes

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I used in the project:

- dio
- bloc
- equatable
- flutter_bloc
- flutter_modular
- dartz
- carousel_slider
- shimmer
- mocktail
- bloc_test
- modular_test
- network_image_mock

I used the Pokemon API where in this app there will be 2 lists, one horizontal and one vertical, where the first list shows the first 5 Pokemon and the second continues the sequence, the lists contain the name and image of the Pokemon.
